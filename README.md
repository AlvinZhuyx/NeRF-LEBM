This is the code for paper "Likelihood-Based Generative Radiance Field with Latent Space Energy-Based Model for 3D-Aware Disentangled Image Representation".

This site is still under construction. Currently the code for Carla with MCMC inference are ready, please see the Carla_MCMC_with_pose folder for more information.
Other codes are under construction and will be ready soon.

Some codes adapted from [this](https://github.com/yenchenlin/nerf-pytorch) awesome pytorch implementation of NeRF
